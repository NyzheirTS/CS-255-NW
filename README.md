# CS-255-NW

 For the DriverPass project we were commissioned by the owner of the company Liam who wanted to take advantage of a void in the market when it comes to training students for driving tests. The goal was to  build a system that can provide online classes and practice tests as well as in person road training. One of the things I felt I did particularly well during the process of building the project was gathering user requirements. I took note of every key point expressed in the interview with the DriverPass representatives and felt like I was able to represent every aspect of the system the client wanted. If i had to choose one part in either document to revise i would revise the gantt chart to include more team members as well as provide a more nuanced breakdown of the timetable. When interpreting the users' needs I tried to come up with solutions that were both technically sound and accomplished the desired utility of the commissioners. It is important to do this in order to create a system that the user can be satisfied with creating a good experience that would make them want to keep coming back. In future endeavors when designing software I will be sure to implore some of the techniques learned throughout this course such as creating gantt charts and multiple UML diagrams each with their own purpose.
